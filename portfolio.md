##Reflection Questions – Portfolio Merge Conflict

1. Why did the conflict occur?
Because I changed the same part of the file in two different branches.
Both of them edited the “Skills” section in different ways, so Git didn’t know which one to keep.

2. What lines in the file were changed in both branches?
The lines under the “## Skills” title were changed.
One branch had “Python, Java, HTML, CSS” and the other had “C++, JavaScript, SQL”.

3. What would have prevented this conflict?
If I had pulled the latest version before I started editing, this wouldn’t have happened.
Also, pushing and merging more often helps to prevent this kind of issue.

4. In real life, how do you avoid conflicts when working on multiple devices?
I think the best way is to always do git pull before working and git push when I finish.
That way all devices stay updated.
Also, I can make small commits more often so I don’t have big differences later.

5. What was the most challenging part of resolving the conflict?
The hardest part for me was understanding those conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
At first it looked confusing, but then I realized I just needed to keep the parts I wanted and delete the markers.

6. How did Git help you identify where the conflict was?
Git showed exactly where the conflict happened.
It put the markers around the lines that were different, so it was easy to see what needed to be fixed.
